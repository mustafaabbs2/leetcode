# :beginner: Mustafa's LeetCode Solutions :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This is my list of Leetcode Solutions. I switch between Python and C++ and you can index the solutions via the table below.

My goals are:

1. Get better at Python and C++ :snake:
2. Overcome the fright of seeing a problem stopping you in your tracks :interrobang:
3. Just solve more puzzles! :smile:
4. Oh, and get cosy with all the data structures and algorithms that I've learnt and never used :tada:
